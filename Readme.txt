Hello! This is a compilation of work I have done for future reference :)

You will find the textbook, solution manual, lecture notes, and tutorials for reference
(NOTE: solution manual numbers sometimes do not match assigned HW numbers due to being from 
a different textbook edition. Just look around the vincinity for the correct solution.)

Submissions for HW and Projects are also included. 
Project work varies in completeness due to lab partner splitting (and laziness for copying Project 4 & Final)

HW Submissions
    HW1 - 43/50 pts
        2.16) -4: incorrect calculation, no calculation for element forces
        3.54) -3: no comparison to exact solution
    HW2 - 45.5/50 pts
        10.4) -2: incorrect shape functions, no calculation showing Jacobian determinate = L/2
        10.15) -2: actual values not calculated for comparison
        12.6) -0.5: please show ANSYS steps (load/support)
    HW3 - 100/100 pts

Project Submissions
